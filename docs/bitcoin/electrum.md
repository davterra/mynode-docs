# Electrum Server

## Enabling Electrum Server

Electrum is a very popular light wallet that lets you use Bitcoin on your PC or mobile device without needing a full copy of the blockchain. By running Electrum Server on your myNode, you can run light wallets on other devices in a trusted manner by offloading the heavy lifting to myNode.

First, from the myNode home page click "Enable" to start running Electrum Server. Depending on the speed of your device, it may take several days to fully sync Electrum. Your device may run slowly during this initial sync period.

Once the server has synced, you should see an Electrum Server status page similar to this.

Connecting an Electrum Wallet to myNode via the GUI

At this point you can connect your Electrum light wallets to your myNode. On the PC version, click on the colored icon in the bottom right to open up server settings. Enter the IP address of your myNode with port 50002.

</center>

If everything went correctly, you will get a green status icon and your myNode device will be acting as your Electrum Server!

At this point, your node may still use other servers for various things. To limit use to ONLY your node, you will need to find the Electrum config file for your application and change some settings.

To find your Electrum files, try these instructions.

Open the config file and make sure the these settings are set as follows:

            "auto_connect": false,
            "oneserver": true,
            

Restart Electrum and you will be using myNode for trusted Electrum access!
