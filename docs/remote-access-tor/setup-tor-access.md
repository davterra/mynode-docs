# Tor Setup

## Using Tor with your myNode

#### Premium Feature

Tor is a technology that allows devices to communicate securely and privately via the Internet. This technology can be incredibly useful to Bitcoin and Lightning by securing connections between the devices you use everyday and your myNode.

By enabling Tor, you can use apps, like Electrum, on your phone or laptop no matter where you are and still rely on the trust your myNode provides.
